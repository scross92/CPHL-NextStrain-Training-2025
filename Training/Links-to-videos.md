# Nextstrain tutorials
This folder contains the materials for the Nextstrain tutorials. Nextstrain has a lot of great documentation and these tutorials can be found at:
https://docs.nextstrain.org/en/latest/install.html# 

Just as a reminder, if you are not familiar with the command-line interface (CLI) and have not completed the Unix Shell tutorial, please do so before proceeding into these tutorials. This can be found here:

For the remote portion of this training, we are only covering the first few available tutorials to:
1) Make sure that your system is set up to properly run Nextstrain
2) Understand the steps behind running a Nextstrain build

When we come together in-person, we will cover the aspects of utilizing Geneious, accessing databases, and making custom Nextstrain builds.
