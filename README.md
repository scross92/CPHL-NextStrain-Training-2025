# Nextstrain Training May-June 2025
This repository contains the associated training documents for the phylogenetic training using Nextstrain.

### What is Nextstrain?

Nextstrain is a powerful analysis and visualization bioinformatic tool. (https://nextstrain.org/) It is an open-source platform to empower researchers and public health officials to "aid epidemiological understanding of pathogen spread and evolution and improve outbreak response."

### Overview of the training

This training will cover asynchronous learning materials where we will work through the available tutorials and documentation available by the Nexstrain team. 

Subsequent in-person training will occur in June 2025 where we will analyze some case studies and deploy Nexstrain on select pathogens.

We will post as much material as possible as soon as possible and as we work through this training together. Our intent is to leave this material online indefinitely.

_Materials will be updated as they are developed so please check back often!_

### Accessing the materials

Materials can be accessed through the appropriate folders:

**Training**: This folder contains the videos and slides for completing the Nextstrain training. Also found in here are additional resources for bioinformatic training

**Lectures**: The lecture slides that are presented in both the asynchronous and the in-person training will be stored here

**Exercises**: Materials for the mock case studies will be provided here

### Understanding the Command Line Interface (CLI)
This training will extensively make use of the command line interface. We recognize that there is a variety of expertise and familiarity with the CLI. Therefore, if you are unfamiliar or need a refresher, please complete this well put together tutorial on navigating and understanding the Unix shell. https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/ 

_We will not have adequate time to do a in depth training in person on navigating and understanding the Unix shell, therefore it is **essential** to complete this if you do no regularly use the Unix shell in your work!!!_
